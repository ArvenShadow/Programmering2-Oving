To run this project, download the zip and open in any IDE.
Preferably have maven installed and run mvn clean install in terminal to verify compatibility.
If maven is not installed, a wrapper is included in the file. Run .\mvnw clean install in terminal. (Common issue with wrapper requires C:\User\MyUser\.... path to NOT include any spacings)
If running wrapper should fail, the program will still function, but test classes has to be run individually.
